Please include a summary of key deliverables.Beware of Apibest and CEO Taras Omelianenko: A Costly Venture Engaging with Apibest, a purported IT service provider led by CEO Taras Omelianenko, has been a regrettable experience. This Ukrainian company, claiming to offer a range of services including IT Managed Services, Enterprise App Modernization, E-Commerce Development, and DevOps services, has proven to be a dubious entity with serious shortcomings. Despite asserting the existence of a fiscal office in the UK, Apibest appears to be little more than a facade. My investigation revealed a lack of any physical presence, raising alarming questions about the transparency and legitimacy of their operations. The issues didn't stop there. Apibest not only failed to meet their commitments but delivered substandard work with consistent delays. It is evident that the company lacks the professional competence required for the services they advertise. Attempts to communicate with CEO Taras Omelianenko and the management team were met with silence. Emails went unanswered, and phone calls were blatantly ignored, leaving us with no recourse after having entrusted them with a substantial sum of money. The repercussions of Apibest's incompetence have been severe, resulting in significant financial losses for my company. This situation is not unique, as I have discovered other companies in Ukraine sharing similar negative experiences with Taras Omelianenko and Apibest. In conclusion, exercising caution is paramount when considering Apibest for IT services. This Ukrainian company, led by Taras Omelianenko, seems more focused on extracting payments than delivering the quality services they claim. My hope is that this review serves as a warning to others, and I encourage those who may have had similar experiences to share their stories to shed light on the dubious practices of Apibest."

            "text": "What were the measurable outcomes from the project that demonstrate progress or success?Regrettably, APIBEST failed to achieve its goals and exhibited a stark absence of progress or success throughout the project. Despite initial expectations, there were no measurable outcomes indicating advancements or positive developments. Key performance indicators remained stagnant or, in some cases, even deteriorated, reflecting a profound lack of success in meeting established objectives. The project, rather than showcasing improvement, was characterized by an unfortunate inability to deliver tangible results or showcase any meaningful progress.Describe their project management. Did they deliver items on time? How did they respond to your needs?Apibest's project management under the helm of CEO and founder Taras Omelianenko was characterized by a series of substantial shortcomings that eventually resulted in a complete project breakdown. Initially, Apibest demonstrated some semblance of efficiency, delivering items on time. However, as the project progressed, it became increasingly evident that the company's management, spearheaded by Taras Omelianenko, was fundamentally flawed, and the skills of the team members were woefully inadequate. Communication breakdowns, frequent missed deadlines, and a lack of strategic direction underscored the deficiencies in Apibest's project management approach. The initial commitment to timely deliveries disintegrated into a chaotic scenario where deadlines were routinely overlooked, and the project timeline extended far beyond the initially agreed-upon scheduleWhat was your primary form of communication with APIBEST?What did you find most impressive or unique about this company?Based on the negative feedback provided, it's challenging to identify anything impressive or unique about Apibest.Are there any areas for improvement or something APIBEST could have done differently?Apibest's performance was an absolute train wreck, and they could have spared themselves a heap of trouble if they bothered to get their act together. Communication was a joke – they couldn't keep us in the loop to save their lives. The project management was a disaster; it's like they were making it up as they went along. The leadership, especially Taras Omelianenko, seemed clueless. Decisions were all over the place, and a clear strategy was nowhere to be found. It's no wonder the team seemed lost. And let's not even talk about how they handled our concerns. It was like shouting into the void. Client needs were obviously at the bottom of their priority list. As for their claim about having a fiscal office in the UK, it's laughable. Transparency clearly isn't in their vocabulary. Skill development? Forget about it. The team seemed like they were learning on the job, and not doing a great job at that."

Many companies currently rely on manual data collection, as there are no immediate regulatory pressures driving them to adopt more advanced practices. However, we understand that regulations will likely necessitate reporting on sustainability data in the future. To proactively address this, we've initiated the development of a Corporate Sustainability Management System. Teaming up with Apiko, we conducted a thorough Discovery process, leading to the creation of a beta version. Our goal is to present this solution to our clients and investors, showcasing its potential to enhance sustainability practices. Our roadmap involves progressing to the development of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and beyond."

This lets us adapt to fluid environments, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. On top of that, the platform opens more doors for us to bring new customers.What is the team composition?We currently work with 2–3 people from Apiko. We’ve cycled a few employees for various roles, but we’ve kept one backend developer throughout the engagement. Apiko has also added a few frontend developers to either help us scale or work on complementary projects so that they don’t interfere with the main one.How did you come to work with Apiko?We found Apiko through research. A few people from our team looked into various companies. Personally, I had positive experiences with developers from Ukraine; there was a different kind of coding culture there in terms of more modern apps. As a result, when we had the shortlist of different agencies, we ultimately decided to pick Apiko. Their cost was also suitable for us. How much have you invested with them?The investment has scaled up and down, but we’ve spent somewhere between $100,000–$200,000. What is the status of this engagement?We started working with Apiko in December 2019, and the engagement is ongoing."

Apiko is concise and clear in their work, and any time we become busy, the team keeps up well with updates and tickets. I haven’t seen any issues here. We have daily standups and use Slack, email, and Skype to communicate. Our teams do calls 3–5 times per week, while product deployments are done weekly.To be clear, we’re the ones doing the management. However, Apiko resources help us set up tickets. Whenever I haven’t set tickets up, the team sets them up themselves. In other words, the engagement has been truly collaborative. What did you find most impressive about them?Apiko’s work is clean and structured — I get what I ask for as long as I give them the details of what I want. Sometimes, they even give us more than what we expect. They’re considerate of the product, and it shows in their work. Are there any areas they could improve?If they have people in our region or a US branch close to Ohio, then that’d be great.Do you have any advice for potential customers?Pick somebody that you’ll want to work with for the long term. Apiko is highly oriented toward building relationships for the long haul, so consider if you want to work with them across many projects."

In total, we’ve worked with five or six of their team members.How did you come to work with Apiko?I had a couple of companies recommended to me, but Apiko kept coming up in Google searches related to the project. At the time, I was researching a framework called Reaction Commerce as a potential component for the project. They had a lot of experience working with this framework, so I reached out to them.

Our previous online presence led the market to believe we were a small company that only took on smaller projects. This presence drew requests for quotes from students and hobbyists, who we care about but don’t make up the whole of our intended customer base. Since working with Apiko, the majority of the quotes coming through are from larger companies, which we’ve been happy with.How did Apiko perform from a project management standpoint?We’re communicating constantly via Slack. We also use Jira for project management and rely on Github to be a code repository. We barely ever email, but we have conference calls twice a week.What did you find most impressive about them?They employ high-quality developers who work quickly and efficiently to deliver error-free code. If any new skill needs arise, they’re sure to match us with the proper resource as well. Their price is also the best I’ve seen by far, which makes it easier to justify the ongoing nature of the project to stakeholders.Are there any areas they could improve?Working with a company in an entirely different time zone was a bit of a challenge for us early on. However, we resolved this issue fairly quickly and communicate well now. The only roadblocks that arise now are if servers go down during the day. They’re pretty responsive in these situations, but I hate waking them up in the middle of the night.Do you have any advice for potential customers?Just reach out and talk with them. Their team is honest about their capabilities–they won’t take a job if they’re not confident they can help you. Be aware of the time zone difference going into the engagement, though."

There’s one for the customers to access the system and submit the help requests and view helper profiles and track the help request. Another system is a helper portal which is a completely different system where helpers can create their own profile and add their visits, change their visits, the status of their visits, and also there’s a resource center where they can check resources and view more information about the customers.The system is impressive. It’s like a Google Calendar from scratch because they can do the caring visits. You understand the complexities when you want to add a caring visit from now on and not change the partnership. There are invoicing features as well because every visit has a value attached to it. It’s how much the helper gets, how much we get, whether there’s a VAT for the business, VAT for the helpers. It’s quite complicated. The third one is the admin functionality where we manage all of that which is quite heavy. It’s all web development, database, and UX/UI design. They did the front- and backend development and database management. They also did the mobile app for the helpers on the go. It’s basically the helper portal on the app. It’s for when they’re visiting customers, they can check everything.The website is based on Java. They also provide ongoing support and maintenance. Now we’re starting the next big round of development with new features.What is the team composition?There were around 10 people including the business people. Around five of them were full-time.How did you come to work with Apiko?I did a Google search. The vetting process was about a year. I wanted to be super careful.How much have you invested with them?We spent $100,000.What is the status of this engagement?We started working together in April 2020 and the work is ongoing."

It’s the project management that makes the difference. They communicate constantly.What did you find most impressive about them?They’re nice people with good intentions. They care about the business and they care about your results. They try to create a long-term customer which is a different concept. They try to create a partnership. Their communication and account management made the difference compared to other companies I’ve worked with in the past.Are there any areas they could improve?They’re based in Estonia and Ukraine. Their English could be improved. It’s not bad but could improve.Do you have any advice for potential customers?Spend time explaining the system. Customers sometimes make the mistake thinking the development partner will understand their system in one day. You should invest in explaining the logic of the system."

Before we fully launch the platform, we want it to be totally free of bugs. They’ve been extremely helpful in testing each function, then resolving any issues that arise. We’ve been delayed by about two months, but we want to be thorough. Most of the setbacks stem from changes requested on our end.We’re also collecting user input from our initial users. Based on that information, we’ve decided to add some tips to guide the user through the application and flow. Apiko is currently helping us implement these updates. We expect to see improvements within the week.How did Apiko perform from a project management standpoint?Honestly, I was terrible in terms of project management at the beginning of the engagement. I didn’t provide them with any written requirements, so we weren’t on the same page for the scope of the project. We realized that was a problem, so we now have a weekly call, and I document my expectations. We’ve also started using Jira and Trello to track the workflow.What did you find most impressive about them?Compared to my previous experiences with outside vendors, Apiko is the most responsive. I can send them an email at any time of day, and they’ll address it immediately.Are there any areas they could improve?It would be nice if the Apiko team provided their own tracking board. Right now, we can see their progress through Upwork, but a customized weekly or monthly report that explains their work would add value to their services.Any advice for potential customers?Speaking from my own experience, I recommend clients lay out specific objectives and clear milestones. Also, both sides should agree on a project management method at the beginning of the engagement."

There were no situations of the team needing to learn a part of the language.

To be honest with you , if she leaves, I might leave too.What did you find most impressive or unique about this company?I have no knowledge about coding, app development, I don't know anything about how to running a Mobile App business , I have absolutely no experience at all, but the only thing I had was an idea.Apiko gave me the confidence that the idea is all you need JEAN so if you can explain to us what you want to accomplish we will build it . That is what they did and so far I am satisfied. They put my idea first. They respected my idea and made it go live.I have learn so much from them , I can say now I have some knowledge and experience . LOL.Are there any areas for improvement or something they could have done differently?Not just them , but I realize most developing company I spoke with do the same thing .When you first start talking to them about your idea, they trying to know about your budget before they can listen about your idea.For me , they have to do both listen to my idea and understand what I want to do, know the budget then give me option to choose from that can make my idea better but do not try to fit my idea into my budget.For example, if your app allow users to chat with each other give me all the features about chatting: text, copy and past , quick chat,...So i can choose from but nope, when you ask why user can't do that and they say yes they can but it will cost and out of your budget.For me that is a waste time and money.

That face-to-face time was incredibly helpful because we had been nervous about our lack of Sitecore experience. During the meeting, Apiqu answered every question on the fly and created a very comfortable environment for the three parties.How did Apiqu perform from a project management standpoint?I ran point on our side and Alexander (Co-Founder, Apiqu) ran point on their side; they also included a developer on calls. We had daily morning regroups; they would then send a breakdown of what they had accomplished that day. I didn’t have to pester Apiqu because the team was always on top of communicating and documenting work. From a project management standpoint, I couldn’t have asked for more. We talked via Skye for Business all the time.What did you find most impressive about them?The team fostered a great relationship with responsive service and outstanding communication skills. In addition, they were well-spoken and required minimal interpretation from our end. That quick back and forth saved us valuable time.Are there any areas they could improve?There were discrepancies between our spend expectations and the actual bill. We should have been clearer about our budget requirements, but they also could have been more transparent.

Search functionality and a blog were added to the new site.What is the team composition?Our main contact was their CTO.

They mainly use Jira to communicate as well for bug fixes and troubleshooting. We also had weekly status update meetings as we got deeper into the devolvement phase of the project. The CTO was occasionally joined on calls by one or two other members of the team.What did you find most impressive about them?We’re very impressed with how fast they work while still delivering quality products and services. Apiqu Inc. is always willing to help us out. They’re very supportive.Are there any areas they could improve?On the communications side of the project, we frequently had to prompt them to relay information to us about how the project was tracking to budget.Any advice for potential customers?Be clear from the start in setting expectations. Make sure they understand how often you want them to communicate on key issues."

We wanted to fully host the faculty bios within our Sitecore platform, which meant allowing 180 or so faculty members to have access to the site and the ability to update their bios. We had a look in mind, so we established the wireframes and the look, and they built them. We also added fields for them to present their latest research and other work they’re doing.We had also been using WordPress to host our admissions team blogging, and it was a poor experience for site users to read a blog on another platform. We had a lot of content that was not being seen, so we asked Apiqu to build internal blogging capabilities.Midway through the project, we went through a visual identity upgrade.

Ask your questions in a couple of different ways. Oftentimes they told us they could deliver a request, but changed their answer as the scope became more complicated. Be buttoned down with your own set of requirements rather than leaving things open-ended."

We launched the new version in 2017. We provide roughly 1,000 trips per day. Once we order a trip, multiple self-controlling features determine the customer's budget, the duration of the service, and their access to certain areas. This software immediately accepts the request or asks for verification, but automatically halts if we try to book a service in the past. Customers can select a wheelchair van, a sedan, a minivan, or a car with booster seats. After each trip, the software enables our quality control department to contact customers and record the results. All our drivers can choose a status on their smartphones. That information is sent back to the office, where it shows on a huge real-time map. That's one of the most attractive, useful features of the platform. We had a feature that showed the real-time location of cars long before popular ride sharing apps even existed.Five monitors sort all our business by timeframe and status. Our representatives can see client movement and visualize business volume. Apiqu also implemented an automatic calculator for driver tardiness and a feature that tells us when drivers are speeding.Before launching the new software, we outsourced a phone-based process and hired many people. Apiqu developed a complete solution. They didn’t trouble us with colors, button shapes, or other small details; they described how the solution would work and sent us a demo. We highlighted the parts that needed improvement, and they devised solutions within the day. Once we implemented this software on the outsourced company’s side, we started saving on human resources costs.What is the team composition?We’ve worked directly with three people out of the six or seven on Apiqu’s team. One focused on communicating feature requests to their Android and iOS departments, and the other two worked on our software.How did you come to work with Apiqu?I’m far removed from tech development. I needed someone who could understand our operations and logistics and explain a product design. After meeting Apiqu’s CEO, I started talking about some of our problems. He gave me his opinion on how I should solve them, and we set up a meeting to talk about the whole picture.How much have you invested with them?The last project cost us around $300,000 CAD (approximately $230,000 USD).What is the status of this engagement?We started working with Apiqu in 2009. Development took a year, and we launched the platform in December 2010. They did a full redevelopment between August 2017 and February 2018, adding many new features."

We have a human-friendly design, and each of the 75 people in our office is happy with it. Since 2009, our annual average growth has been around 35%, with half of that growth because of the platform. It’s so detail-oriented that our employees can see every detail about our collaborators and clients.We showed the software to a government institute that is keen on the security and protection of private information, and they’ve started using it. We started collaborating with them in April 2018, and it took them one month and two or three training sessions to learn the system. We’ve received nothing but compliments from them. This relationship brings in around $10 million per year.How did Apiqu perform from a project management standpoint?I would give them a 9.5/10. This is a software project, so we work 24/7. If we tell them about something we don’t like, all their people are on the phone around-the-clock.If we explain what we want to solve, they give us a plan within a few days. They add our requested features relatively quickly. After testing, we’re done. They’re available at night and fix everything within an hour. Their reaction time is excellent. Most importantly, they know what they’re doing.They wanted to share a system that's mainly designed for developers. We can launch issues for Apiqu to address them. We’ve used the system, but I wasn't part of the testing.What did you find most impressive about them?They’re good workers and receptive designers. Are there any areas they could improve?Apiqu is a partner now, so we can tell them about anything we don’t like. They work on issues until we're fully satisfied; it’s not a take-it-or-leave-it collaboration. Therefore, it’s hard to say whether they could do anything differently. As long as we're happy, I don't know if a different model would be better than the one we have now."

A knowledgeable team! It was a quick delivery and was highly professional through every step of the way. We had a great experience with OGScapital. For our budget, this team went above and beyond our expectations. The work is evident that they know what they are doing. The research is thorough and gives us a great point of perspective for our company!Are there any areas for improvement?Through the three weeks that we worked with OGS capital, I would love to see a way to monitor what is being worked on. For example, if a market analysis was completed, then a confirmation would be sent regarding step 1 of the 14 steps per se would be shown as done.This would give a sense of reassurance during the 14 days of work. It would be great to maybe incorporate slack or basecamp. I would love to see the structure of the team or what marketing resources would be used for our development ahead of time.
